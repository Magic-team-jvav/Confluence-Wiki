# Quick Info

**Q:** How do I progress in the game?  
**A:** It is recommended to have played Terraria first before playing this mod, since it combines both the essence of Terraria and Minecraft to create an entirely original experience. If you wish to progress anyway, you can use the Terraria wiki.

**Q:** How far is Confluence: Otherworld along in progression?  
**A:** Confluence: Otherworld is currently in pre-hardmode. The current latest boss you can fight is Skeletron. The Wall of Flesh can only be summoned with a spawn egg and is unfinished, but it won't set your world to hardmode.

**Q:** Is this a modpack?  
**A:** This is a standalone mod. However, we have an offical modpack. [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/adm-confluence-otherworld)

# World Generation & Biomes

**Q:** How can I find specific biomes and structures?  
**A:** You can download Nature's Compass and Explorer's Compass, they're mods with a compass that point to the biomes/structures you're looking for.

**Q:** Are the corruption and crimson separate biomes and can I find them both in the same world?  
**A:** They're both separate biomes, you can't find them both in the same world. Only using the special terraria seed will let you.  
*Note:* World generation mods may cause both to spawn.

**A:** You can find the dungeon using either the dungeon ritual **(Wiki Unfinished)** or Explorer's Compass. There are 128 dungeons in a world.

**Q:** Where do I find the locked chests in the dungeon?  
**A:** You can find the locked chests in a building in the dungeon. The building has a sword handle sticking out on top, so you've got to look very closely to it. You can also spot them easily if there are stairs at the left with doors on it on the ground floor.

**Q:** How do I get a hellforge?  
**A:** Bring a Deathbringer/Nightmare/Netherite pickaxe to the nether and find a nether tower. It will be located at the bottom.
