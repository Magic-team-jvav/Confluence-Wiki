Secret seeds can be triggered by entering them in the world seed column (they are not fixed seeds that generate fixed worlds like in Minecraft).  

Each secret seed can generate a different world with special properties every time.  

If you want to retain the seed of their original world, after using the `/seed` command, in the seed column, enter:  

(Secret Seed) | (Regular World Seed)

to copy the original world (as shown in the picture).
