# Bosses
A boss is a special, powerful enemy that usually appears at key points in the game. Bosses are stronger than normal enemies and often require preparation, strategy, and specific items to defeat.

Defeating a boss typically:

- Advances the game’s progression (unlocking new areas, crafting materials, or events).

- Drops rare items or equipment that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

 While not all are required to progress, it can be very helpful to defeat them. Bosses Marked with * in their name are required to progress.
